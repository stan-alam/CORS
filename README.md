# CORS
Cross Origin Resource Sharing


    CORS from the ground up
    Serving and consuming cross-domain data
    Best practices for building CORS APIs
    When to use CORS alternatives like JSON-P and proxies

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) from both the server and the client perspective. It starts with the basics: how to make CORS requests and how to implement CORS on the server. It then explores key details such as performance, debugging, and security. API authors will learn how CORS opens their APIs to a wider range of users. JavaScript developers will find valuable techniques for building rich web apps that can take advantage of APIs hosted anywhere. The techniques described in this book are especially applicable to mobile environments, where browsers are guaranteed to support CORS.
Suppose you need to share some JSON data with another application or service. If everything is hosted on one domain, it’s a snap. But if the data is on another domain, the browser’s “same-origin” policy stops you cold. CORS is a new web standard that enables safe cross-domain access without complex server-side code. Mastering CORS makes it possible for web and mobile applications to share data simply and securely.
